Factors influencing the price of flight reservations are explored through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. The analysis reveals significant factors impacting ticket prices, although the overall effect is relatively minor.\n\nKey variables influencing ticket prices are identified through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), considering the multitude of variables affecting the outcome. Prediction of ticket prices is accomplished using the ExtraTreesRegressor model, demonstrating an impressive accuracy of 97.95%. Additionally, data preprocessing is performed using RobustScaler to scale the data, mitigating the impact of outliers and reducing overfitting. This step enhances the model's performance by minimizing data dispersion and preventing overfitting.\n\nThe results of this analysis provide valuable insights into the factors affecting flight ticket prices, contributing to a better understanding of the dynamics in the airline industry. The predictive model's high accuracy underscores its potential for practical applications in forecasting flight ticket prices.","metadata":{"id":"T9993VJ1kso7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) ,  ExtraTreesRegressor ,  RobustScaler**","metadata":{"id":"5tgDHwTcnflZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Introduction: Analyzing a dataset derived from the \"Ease My Trip\" website's flight bookings, this study employs various statistical hypothesis tests to extract meaningful insights.

results indicate that the ExtraTreesRegressor model outperforms the Linear Regression model in terms of prediction accuracy. However, there are still high values for Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), suggesting room for improvement. Scaling the data is recommended for further refinement.\n\nAdditionally, a feature selection test using ANOVA will be conducted to identify the most impactful factors for the new

The top 6 influential factors, ranked in descending order, are airline, departure time, stops, class type, duration, and days left. In this data processing iteration, it is advisable to perform data preprocessing, specifically **RobustScaler**, to minimize the data distribution concerning high or low values.\n\nThe chosen model for prediction is **ExtraTreesRegressor**, as it demonstrates higher accuracy compared to Linear Regression. Additionally, the use of Analysis of Variance **(ANOVA)** is recommended for selecting the most impactful factors, given its enhanced performance.\n\nIt is crucial to emphasize that the selection of a model and factors should align with the suitability of the dataset under analysis. Further experimentation can involve testing all factors in the model, exploring alternative scaling methods, and considering other models to optimize prediction accuracy.","metadata":{"id":"iy3j9tEfZeiJ"}}]}
